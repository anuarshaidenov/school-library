# school-library

> Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them.

The app will allow you to:

- Add new students or teachers.
- Add new books.
- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.
- And all of this will be built in a beautiful and well-organized way!
